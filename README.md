This repo is DEPRECATED
=======================

Highly recommend you try out https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imagus/immpkjjlgappgfkkfieppnmlhakdmaab as I've decided to discontinue support for HoverFree.
============================================================================================================================================

hoverfree 
=========

Fork of hoverzoom.net -- this Chrome extension will show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.

Read why here: https://gist.github.com/ralph-tice/5087704 or see http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19oy0s/hoverzoom_has_gone_evil_tracking_browsing_history/ for discussion.


Philosophy:
===========

HoverFree will be free to use and help people preview a linked image.

HoverFree will never inject advertising, referral links, adware, spyware, etc.

HoverFree will never track or record browsing activity.

Installation:
=============

Easiest method is Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-free/hcmnnggnaofmhflgomfjfbndngdoogkj

For manual installation, simplest method is:
```
git archive --format zip --output ~/hoverfree.zip master 
```

Over 24,000 weekly users as of 7/13!
